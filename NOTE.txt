In order to fix Heroku issues:
    Lower the django version to 3.2 instead of 4, and add required python version to runtime (3.9.15)
    Delete the env/, and then MANUALLY install all the libraries
    (install gunicorn, and add runtime.txt, Procfile)

Install Whitenoise in order to load css in production
